### Overview

This project builds on the classic PacMan game. 
It keeps the features with "PacMac", "walls, "ghost", and "eating items", and it applies the original rules,
such as "PacMac" will lose one life once it meets a "ghost". 
Different from classic version, this project used the abstract class and interfaces to increase its extensibility. 
Therefore, a user can increase the difficulty level by add more paths and more ghosts. 
For the project design, Java is used to support the backend, while the frontend uses JavaScript, 
HyperText Markup Language (HTML), and Cascading Style Sheets (CSS).
